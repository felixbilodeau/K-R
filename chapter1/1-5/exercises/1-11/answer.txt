The question asks: How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input
are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

I would say to test the program, I would use a text that I already know the
number of words, lines and characters to, and then use that as the input to
the program, and match the outputs

For the kinds of inputs that may uncover bugs, we need to check boundary conditions,
like an empty input, a single word, a line not ended by \n, just a bunch of spaces,
stuff like that
